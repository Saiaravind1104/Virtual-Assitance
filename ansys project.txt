In ansys we  design high frequency transformer in 3d by using maxwell 3d
In wizards there is differnt type of modules, we select electronic transformer for designing for high frequency transformer.
1)comeing to CORE DEFINTION:-
         here we defin dimension of core and what type of core is used fot the transformer.there is differnt type of cores like etd,e,efd,p.we select 
etd type core for the desighning.


2)WINDING DEFINATION:-
         Here we select no layers is requried for the transformer.we define 2 because it is single phase transformer so 1layer is primary and another layer 
is secondary.and here we difine layer spacing ,conducter type .we define circle conductor type.after we define how many turns requried for the transformer.
so according to my theoritical caluclations, primary having 8turns and secondary having 3turns.
                                    
                                     "After the transformer will be design like this".

3)ANALYSIS SETUP:-
          In alasys setup there is options like what type of material used for the core an coil , According to my theortical calculations we define 
core material as feriate and coil material as copper. then we set the how frequency. we set as 25Khz

Before setup the analysis.we need to define . which layer is primary and which layer is secondary.after that we setup an region for analysis.

then we give current excitation to the primary and secondary winding,according to my theoritical calucalations we define 10A as primary current
7.5A foe secondary winding

After simulations the result will be like this:
The results for both flux distribution and inductance is nearer to my theoritical caluclations
